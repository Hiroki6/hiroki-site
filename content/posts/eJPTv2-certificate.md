Over the weekend, I took the eJPT exam offered by [ine.com](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/).

The exam allowed a duration of 48 hours. I started the exam at 9am then finished at around at 3pm.
Although I initially believed I had achieved a perfect score, it appears I made a single error.

Prior to the exam, I read some advice from several articles.
These three pieces of advice were especially helpful.
- Don't rush.
- If they don’t want you to use brute force, you’ll know.
- If you’re stuck, try those tools in the lab that you haven’t used.

During the exam, [CherryTree](https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/) and the [template](https://411hall.github.io/OSCP-Preparation/) were very helpful to take a note about the machines.
