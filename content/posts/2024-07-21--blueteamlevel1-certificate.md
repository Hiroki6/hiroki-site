Over the weekend, I took the Blue Team Level1(BTL1) exam offered by [securityblue.team](https://www.securityblue.team/why-btl1/).

The exam allowed a duration of 24 hours. I started the exam at 9am then finished at around at 2pm.

I spent a total of 2 months preparing for the exam, which included:
1. Following the provided content and labs.
2. Completing some investigations and challenges in [BLUE TEAM LABS ONLINE](https://blueteamlabs.online/)
3. completing [Boss of the SOC Version 1](https://bots.splunk.com/event/3oQ7sqI5bajOCP43o0svqT/detail)

During the preparation, I learned many things, such as threat intelligence, phishing analysis, and digital forensics. I also became familiar with various tools, including Splunk, Wireshark, Autopsy, and DeepBlueCli. It was a good starting point in this field.
